# Software Fault Prediction using Transformers

## Introduction
In this project, I've been delving into the fascinating realm of software fault prediction. The goal is to leverage the power of transformers, which excel at comprehending the context of code, to predict software bugs. Among the various transformer model types available, I've chosen to focus on the "encoder-only" models. This model type excels at capturing and understanding the intricate contexts within code, making them particularly suited for our task.

## Transformer Models for Bug Prediction
### Encoder-Only Model
For our software fault prediction task, the encoder-only transformer model emerges as the most promising candidate. This model type excels at capturing the essence of code context, which is crucial for effective bug prediction. By concentrating solely on the encoding aspect, we can harness its capabilities to their fullest extent.

### UniXcoder by CodeBERT
As part of my exploration, I've also delved into UniXcoder by CodeBERT. This tool offers a unique feature to choose between different modes of the transformer, namely encoder-only or decoder-only. This flexibility allows us to align the model's behavior with our specific use case requirements, further enhancing its potential for accurate bug predictions.

## Data Limitations and Innovative Approaches
Despite the immense potential of the chosen approach, we face a challenge in the form of a scarcity of labeled training data. To overcome this hurdle, we're considering innovative techniques such as:
- **Zero-Shot Learning:** This technique involves training the model to make predictions even in the absence of labeled data from the target class. The model generalizes its understanding from other related classes, enabling it to perform adequately even with limited labeled samples.
- **Few-Shot Learning:** With this approach, we provide the model with a small number of labeled examples. This helps the model grasp the characteristics of the target class and make predictions more accurately.

## Fine-Tuning CodeBERT
To adapt a transformer model to our specific use case, I've chosen to fine-tune the CodeBERT model. This involves training the model on our dataset, which is carefully curated to enhance its bug prediction abilities. By fine-tuning, we're essentially tailoring CodeBERT's understanding of code context to align with our software fault prediction objectives.
